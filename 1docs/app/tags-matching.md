The main value of this site / tool is to connect (match) entities (people or organizations). Questions (a la OkCupid), personality tests, etc. can be used but we're starting with a self-selected / rated priority system of tags with "vouches" from the public to confirm / deny those ratings.
Each tag has both a quantitative (rating) and qualitative (comment) aspect. The quantitative is used for matching / algorithms and the comments are meant to back those ratings up. Entities can be searched based on self-scoring and/or public scoring.


## Categories

There are 4 categories of tags, based on the general "culture" and "skills" split - the idea that a match is a good one if the two parties would enjoy working together / spending time together AND if they can do the job / get the work done.

1. values - internal culture of how an organization, individual / investor lives / runs day by day - e.g. openness, transparency, giving
2. mission - external focus area / sector / market / passion that org / individual pursues - e.g. environment, solar, health care
3. skills - labor - what an individual / organization offers - e.g. web development, design, construction
4. resources - capital - what an individual / organization offers - e.g. money, land, housing / office space

Resources are somewhat "experimental" and for the future as really money is likely going to be the main one and we'll handle that as a special case with the "investors". But we'll leave it in for completeness and may add it later. In a "Gifting Economy" much more than just money will be traded so this will make more sense then.


## Locations, Roles

For people, they are just one person so are in location and have one set of skills. But for organizations comprised of multiple people, they likely will have multiple locations and multiple people, with each one potentially being (slightly) different and seeking (slightly) different things. Locations are handled simply by "cloning" and existing organization and then removing these locations from the original. But roles are more tricky as we can not simply clone an entire organization for EACH different role.


## Status / Matching / Roles

Each entity adds the tags it has currently has and what it is seeking. This is used for matching.

So in full, each entity would denote 8 different sets of tags - 2 for each category (one for 'have' and one for 'seeking').

In general values and mission are likely to be shared - each party would want to match with people who value the same things. And these are likely to be shared across all locations and roles for the organization as well. Though perhaps some values may be higher or lower priorities for different roles.

And while in Teal organizations a person may shift roles fluidly and likely is not / should not be hired for a particular role, as a team they do need complimentary skillsets. So it makes sense to sub-group skills by "role" rather than listing ALL skills all together. Similarly, different skill groups will likely (for better or worse) have different compensation and potentially other unique attributes so it will be important to sub-group skills and be able to differentiate these attributes. Resources likely will not be differentiated by role - either the person has the resources or he/she does not. So the differentiation really only applies to skills.

So practically speaking we can probably leave out some of the 8 total sets of tags based on the entity:

- people
  - values (have & seek)
  - mission (have & seek)
  - skills-have
  - skills-seek (for co-founder matching, not really applicable for joining an organization)
  - resources-have (for co-founder matching)
  - resources-seek
- organizations
  - values (have & seek)
  - mission (have & seek)
  - skills-seek (for co-founder matching, not really applicable for joining an organization)
    - [role-specific differentiations]
  - resources-seek


### Role Attributes

CEB has an "Employment Value Proposition (EVP)" model that lists several attributes important to employees. All are important though again most will likely be shared across all roles, especially for a Teal / flat organization.
